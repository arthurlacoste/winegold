# Todo list

- [ ] Working UI for processing files
 - [ ] Process all files
 - [ ] Cancel button
 - [ ] Choose script to start
 - [ ] Save default script selected in config file
- [ ] Scan scripts folder instead of using config file for it (simpler & better)
- [ ] Display "process all files" when there is files to process (better).
- [ ] Handle queue: add multiples files queue (and set it with "queue")
- [ ] Restart process
- [ ] Add npm dependencies checker in before
- [ ] Multi-platform command
- [ ] Prompt support
